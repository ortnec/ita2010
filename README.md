Welcome to the msp430 Challenge
====================================

If you've made it this far then it's safe to assume you've solved the first few steps. Congratulations, don't stop now!

Next Steps
----------

We've only got a few more steps before you can claim the prize. To start, go to the [downloads][downloads] section of this repo and get [prog2.elf][prog2.elf]. Now it's up to you to figure out how to get it loaded onto your LaunchPad and complete the last challenge. Don't worry, this time you won't even need a piece of wire.

Notes
-----

* See [TI's Wiki][TI Wiki] for help getting your computer configured as well as reference documentation and example code.

* The prog1.c file in the [downloads][downloads] represents the code your LaunchPad came preloaded with. Feel free to use and modify it.

* Both [prog1.elf][prog1.elf] and [prog2.elf][prog2.elf] were built with [llvm-msp430](https://www.fooe.net/trac/llvm-msp430/) on OS X 10.6 following the instructions on [TI's wiki][TI Wiki]. If you have any issues building prog1.c with IAR or Code Composer Studio please let me know.
